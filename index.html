    After weeks of research and an email discussion with a well known Harvard
    PHD molecular biologist on the topic, this research data is gathered here
    in logical format so that every country and media company in the World can
    understand how SARS-COV-2 (cause of COVID-19), or its direct ancestor
    before mutation in humans, was likely leaked from a Wuhan lab into the
    public.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    NOTE: Sadly some in the bio-research industry (such as Peter Daszak) have
    seemingly been attempting to use a smokescreen of “it looks natural, not
    engineered” as a way to protect controversial “gain-of-function” virology
    research funding, as some bio-research labs will likely close once the
    majority of the public knows that SARS-COV-2 almost DEFINITELY leaked from
    a Wuhan research lab (approximately 99.99999% likelihood currently, based
    on publicly available data). Breeding enhanced variations of viruses in a
    lab by infecting multiple ferrets (or other animals with ACE2 receptors
    similar to humans), and selecting resulting viral mutations from that
    group, is seemingly a relatively common way to do “gain of function”
    virology research. Basically the lab selects from the mutations of a virus
    resulting from the spread through various lab animals and a resulting
    enhanced bat coronavirus would look very “natural”.

    (How SARS-COV-2 Likely Leaked From A Wuhan Virology Research Lab)
</p>
<p align="center">
    (Presented in a way to be understandable by most of the adult public in
    Western nations)
</p>
<p>
    1. Starting with the MOST important proof to make sure it’s blatantly
    obvious from the start: According to the official "Report of the WHO-China
    Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)”(a), the most
    identical genome sequence (96.x percent identical) to SARS-COV-2 that is
    publicly known is: "BatCov RaTG13”, also known as "Bat coronavirus RaTG13”.
    That genome sequence was uploaded to the NCBI genome database by The Wuhan
    Institute of Virology. Yes, a Wuhan research lab. That Wuhan lab’s name is
    literally on the genome sequence database submission(b). That is a bat
    (rhinopholus affinis, AKA: an intermediate horseshoe bat) coronavirus
    sample reportedly collected in June 2013 by that Wuhan research lab. 2013
    was during a known period that employees of that Wuhan lab are documented
    to have been collecting samples from caves (and a mine shaft where a miner
    reportedly passed away from a weird “pneumonia”) in the southwest region of
    china. Most likely that bat coronavirus sample (or the bat carrying it) was
    collected from or near Yunnan, according to some of that Wuhan lab’s
    research papers.
</p>
<p>
    Richard H. Ebright (a well known Harvard PHD molecular biologist and
    documented on Wikipedia as "the Board of Governors Professor of Chemistry
    and Chemical Biology at Rutgers University and Laboratory Director at the
    Waksman Institute of Microbiology”) has stated very clearly in an email
    that the 3.x percent difference between "Bat coronavirus RaTG13” and
    SARS-COV-2 could have resulted from spreading a bat coronavirus through
    multiple lab animals (ferrets or another lab animal that has similar ACE2
    receptors as humans do) in a Wuhan research lab. Basically Ebright has
    confirmed that the notorious “spike protein” found on SARS-COV-2 is also
    present in the genome sequence of "Bat coronavirus RaTG13”. Those 2
    coronaviruses are basically in a genetic lineage that ONLY those 2 publicly
    documented genome sequences are members of. Richard Ebright confirmed by
    saying: "RaTG13 has all features except two: receptor-binding-domain
    sequence optimized for ACE-2 binding, and furin cleavage site”. Then when
    asked if those features could have been added to "Bat coronavirus RaTG13”
    by passing that bat coronavirus through multiple animals in a Wuhan
    research lab (a gain-of function breeding process that would look
    “natural”), Richard Ebright answered “Yes”!

    2. There is PLENTY of precedent showing that research lab safety in china
    is and has been a MAJOR risk to the World. Sadly MANY chinese lab employees
    have been infected with various pathogens at various chinese research labs
    in china over the years. As recently as December 2019 (yes, that recently),
    both the science journal Nature(a) and also Newsweek(b) reported about an
    incident at another chinese research lab in china where “more than 100
    students"(b) were reportedly infected by Brucella (yes, another chinese
    research lab in maybe the same month as the likely Wuhan lab leak, although
    a Wuhan lab leak may have been a month or more before). According to
    another Nature magazine article(c) from 2017 about that Wuhan lab, "The
    SARS virus has escaped from high-level containment facilities in beijing
    multiple times”. That article is aptly titled: "Inside the chinese lab
    poised to study world's most dangerous pathogens”. In that same article
    Richard Ebright had been quoted expressing some concerns: "“These
    facilities are inherently dual use,” he says. The prospect of ramping up
    opportunities to inject monkeys with pathogens also worries, rather than
    excites, him: “They can run, they can scratch””

    3. <strong>The Wuhan Institute of Virology</strong> (well known in
    bio-research community for gathering and studying bat coronaviruses)
    contains the first (and possibly still the ONLY) BSL-4 (bio-safety level 4)
    research lab in china. That lab is located approximately 12km from the
    Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (the wet market in Wuhan where the global
    pandemic was originally believed to have started). Technically that
    research lab is about 14km walking distance (a) from that wet market and
    that is obviously EXTREMELY near, ESPECIALLY considering that Wuhan is the
    epicenter of an international pandemic. "Biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) is the
    highest level of biosafety precautions, and is appropriate for work with
    agents that could easily be aerosol-transmitted within the laboratory and
    cause severe to fatal disease in humans for which there are no available
    vaccines or treatments.”(b)
</p>
<p>
    NOTE: Sadly in china there is almost definitely no such thing as a
    bio-safety lab that is ACTUALLY at BSL-4 safety level by Western standards.
    Any expat from a Western nation that has resided in china long enough knows
    that was very likely the situation at that lab. There is a VERY common
    chinese word “chabuduo”, that basically describes the quality standard
    inherent in chinese culture (similar to saying “close enough” or “tolerably
    passable” in English), and is one of many examples of how the highest level
    safety lab in china is more likely at a lower safety level than publicly
    stated. Considering that the chinese government reportedly decided to hire
    a chinese construction company (instead of the French that were seemingly
    originally supposed to have been building it), it is very, very
    questionable how safe that lab is. If every research lab in china is
    actually functioning at a bio-safety level one tier or more below the
    publicly stated safety level, that would explain why so many chinese labs
    have leaked pathogens into chinese lab employees.

    4. Sadly the Wuhan Institute of Virology (according it its official
    website) also has "different biosafety level laboratories for working on
    human pathogens, including 17 biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) labs, one animal
    BSL-2 (ABSL-2) lab and two BSL-3 labs.” Quoting Professor Ebright in an
    article from another science journal: “bat coronaviruses at Wuhan [Center
    for Disease Control] and Wuhan Institute of Virology routinely were
    collected and studied at BSL-2, which provides only minimal protections
    against infection of lab workers.”

    5. The Wuhan WHCDC is another research lab in Wuhan that is less than 1.5km
    from that Huanan Seafood Wholesale market (actually the chinese government
    prevents google maps from being perfectly accurate and a chinese research
    paper(a) stated it’s nearer than 500km). That lab was also reportedly
    handling bat coronaviruses. Quoting that chinese research paper containing
    the map data: "We noted two laboratories conducting research on bat
    coronavirus in Wuhan, one of which was only 280 meters from the seafood
    market.” And another quote from that paper about a researcher at that lab
    that was in a chinese government propaganda movie about chinese research
    labs: "He described that he was once by attacked by bats and the blood of a
    bat shot on his skin. He knew the extreme danger of the infection so he
    quarantined himself for 14 days”. And also from that paper: "The WHCDC was
    also adjacent to the Union Hospital where the first group of doctors were
    infected during this epidemic.” And another quote: "It is plausible that
    the virus leaked around and some of them contaminated the initial patients
    in this epidemic, though solid proofs are needed in future study.”

<p>
    6. A researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology named Zhengli Shi (AKA:
    “the bat woman” (a)) is also listed as an author and team member on a 2015
    project that previously made a hybrid (chimeric) virus that notably added a
    “spike protein”. To quote that paper: "Therefore, to examine the emergence
    potential (that is, the potential to infect humans) of circulating bat
    CoVs, we built a chimeric virus encoding a novel, zoonotic CoV spike
    protein—from the RsSHC014-CoV sequence that was isolated from Chinese
    horseshoe bats”(b) There is A LOT more info about Zhengli Shi and her
    dangerous research in a recent Scientific American article about her that
    was seemingly written by a chinese writer in Beijing, named “Jane Qiu”. The
    article was seemingly written as an attempt to gain prestige, but the
    article actually shows that a Wuhan lab almost DEFINITELY leaked SARS-COV-2
    (or its direct ancestor before mutation in humans). The article on the
    Scientific American website states that Zhengli Shi is quoted as saying
    this when she was contacted by the institute’s director about some patients
    in a Wuhan hospital having a novel coronavirus: "“I wondered if [the
    municipal health authority] got it wrong,” “I had never expected this kind
    of thing to happen in Wuhan, in central China.” “could they have come from
    our lab?””. Zhengli Shi had been doing research in Yunnan and had found
    direct transmission of bat coronaviruses to some chinese inhabitants near
    caves there. In a research paper(c) dated September 2019 titled
    "Human-animal interactions and bat coronavirus spillover potential among
    rural residents in Southern China”(c) with Zhengli Shi listed as an author,
    it is stated: "Nine participants (0.6%) tested positive for bat
    coronaviruses. 265 (17%) participants reported severe acute respiratory
    infections (SARI) and/or influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms in the past
    year” and "This study provides serological evidence of bat coronavirus
    spillover in rural communities in Southern China.”

    7. That is OBVIOUSLY a mountain of peer reviewed scientific proof already
    presented in this paper. This section is added to further clarify some of
    the science behind what Richard Ebright had stated in an email about the
    possibility that "BatCov RaTG13” could have been spread through multiple
    ferrets (or other lab animals with ACE2 receptors similar to those in
    humans) in a Wuhan research lab to breed (by selection) the 3.x percent
    difference between the genome sequence of bat coronavirus BatCovRaTG13 and
    the virus now known as SARS-COV-2 (cause of COVID-19). That is not to say
    it was bred by a Wuhan to intentionally be a “bio-weapon” or similar,
    because I do not currently know of any completely definite proof of that.
    The purpose of the majority of “gain-of-function” virology research is
    seemingly “what if” scenarios. Basically “gain of function” virology
    research is similar to saying: “what if some natural evolution happened?”
    (including scenarios that may have never happened naturally) and attempting
    to prepare for those. The basic process to breed enhancements onto a virus
    seems vaguely similar, in some ways, to breeding a species of poodle with
    enhanced traits. Select the poodle that has the desired traits and continue
    doing so successively until the optimal poodle species results. Sadly there
    has been some such “gain of function” research done by some virology labs
    in the World to enhance viruses in the past decade. Again, the concept is
    generally that such research is done to prevent vaguely possible future
    versions of viruses that have a vague possiblity of occuring naturally
    sometime, somewhere…although some possibly billions of years from now.
    Thus, many have questioned whether such research is safe and if it is worth
    the risk of accidentally leaking a global pandemic from a research lab into
    the human species.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to how Richard Ebright already confirmed that spreading "Bat
    coronavirus RaTG13” through lab animals with ACE2 receptors similar to
    humans (such as ferrets), another research paper published in Nature titled
    “The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2”(a) also seemingly confirms that to be
    true. Sadly though, the authors of that article seem to be attempting some
    smokescreen to protect the bio-research industry, so read the wording in
    that specific paper VERY CAREFULLY, if reading it. Some of it seems overly
    “opinionated” and from a Western ethics standpoint (not a chinese
    perspective) and seemingly attempts to dissuade the reader from some facts
    intentionally (for instance, by mentioning the already disproven pangolin
    theory, although the genome sequence of the bat coronavirus submitted by
    the Wuhan Institute of Virology is MUCH more similar to the full SARS-COV-2
    genome sequence than any known coronavirus found in pangolins). Thankfully
    the paper still admits that SARS-COV-2 could have been leaked by a Wuhan
    lab: "In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired RBD mutations
    during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in
    studies of SARS-CoV. “ and "Mutations, insertions and deletions can occur
    near the S1–S2 junction of coronaviruses, which shows that the polybasic
    cleavage site can arise by a natural evolutionary process. For a precursor
    virus to acquire both the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the
    spike protein suitable for binding to human ACE2, an animal host would
    probably have to have a high population density (to allow natural selection
    to proceed efficiently) and an ACE2-encoding gene that is similar to the
    human ortholog.” That sort of “population density” of ferrets or similar
    would have been possible in a research lab intentionally breeding a
    gain-of-function enhanced coronavirus by infecting those research lab
    animals with bat coronavirus RaTG13.
</p>
<p>
    There is a statement in that research paper that a bat coronavirus would
    have had to have been isolated to have accomplished that. A lab in Wuhan
    has obviously isolated a bat coronavirus already(d). Actually it seems a
    Wuhan lab or labs have isolated multiple bat coronaviruses, as another
    research paper titled "Isolation and characterization of a bat SARS-like
    coronavirus that uses the ACE2 receptor” has Zhengli Shi’s name listed as
    an author. Perhaps the authors of that “The proximal origin of
    SARS-CoV-2”(a) paper did not know that Zhengli Shi was involved in prior
    isolation of bat coronaviruses. Although from the general overly
    opinionated and misleading tone of some sections of that paper, it seems
    more likely the authors were trying to intentionally dissuade the public
    from focusing on an EXTREMELY likely Wuhan lab leak of SARS-COV-2.
</p>
<p>
    That “The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2”(a) research paper also links to
    another research paper(b) about the process of adding "polybasic cleavage
    sites” to enhance a virus. That linked paper was about the EXTREMELY
    controversial "gain of function" research that had been done to breed an
    enhancement in avian bird flu. H5N1 (enhanced avian bird flu) is a
    notorious gain-of-function enhanced coronavirus (A CORONAVIRUS!) that was
    bred in a lab by spreading a type of avian flu through multiple lab
    animals. H5N1 research was so controversial that the scientific community
    had apparently considered not publishing the process of how it was done
    publicly, as it was so risky if that technique was used and a virus was
    accidentally leaked. An article(c) about that prior H5N1 research on the
    Scientific American states: "Ten ferrets, some bird flu and swabs. That is
    all, according to a presentation last summer, one needs to concoct a
    virulent strain of influenza that could start a deadly pandemic among
    humans.”

    8. On February 15, 2020, china’s “ministry of science and technology”
    (title translated with google translate) announced new increased safety
    requirements for chinese bio-research labs in china in a document titled:
    "Guiding Opinions on Strengthening the Biosafety Management of the New
    Coronavirus High-level Viral Microbiology Laboratory”(a) (translated with
    google translate). This is a quote from that news announcement "the
    competent departments also emphasized the need to strengthen the management
    of laboratories, especially viruses, to ensure biological safety. Ensure
    biological safety!” So OBVIOUSLY that is MAJOR proof that a Wuhan lab
    likely leaked SARS-COV-2 into the chinese public! That specifically
    mentions “coronavirus”!!!

    The data already presented in this document ABSOLUTELY SHOULD be enough
    proof to convince ANY intelligent adult from a Western country that
    SARS-COV-2 (or its direct ancestor before mutation in humans) almost
    DEFINITELY was leaked from a chinese research lab in Wuhan.
